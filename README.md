Tech Store Project
This project is my variation of an electronic devices trading store. As I do not have access to an actual server, I have used DB json to imitate actual server's functionality. 

Features

-DB json: In an absence of a back-end side of the project I have stored all of the required information in this file: information regarding products, active and blocked users as well as information regarding the cart contents of each individual user.

-Log in and registration: You have the option to register new users that even after closing the browser will stay registered, as well as you can log in into an administrative account and access admin panel. Also, if you are blocked by the admin's account you will not be able to log in.

-Admin panel: At first, you need to login into the administrative account. Afterwards, you will see 4 main options: access the shop, dashboard, products, and log out button. Firstly, you will appear in the dashboard field by default, where you can view all of the reigstered users and edit their profiles: block/unblock/delete them, change their user stats. In the products section you are able to add products and edit them, as well as delete any product if needed. By clicking on the shop button you will be redirected to the store page.

-Shop: The shop has log in and sign up options: if you are not logged in you cannot add or remove any of the shop items from your cart, while the opposite is true for the logged in users. Here you can see the profile picture of the current user, where by clicking on the profile picture you can review the full name of the user as well as the log out button. The searchbar on top of the page is fully functioning and uses key words to search the right products. The cart icon on the right corner of the page is ment to store all of the items you have previously chosen to buy, with options of editing the choices and seeing the amount needed to be paid. All and all, in this section you can see all of the common functions every online shop has.

This is merely a short description of a large project so I would encourage everyone to review the code and test out everything by themselves.
